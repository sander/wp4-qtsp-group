# Feature: Verification of attributes

The QTSP verifies attributes at their authentic sources before issuing QEAA.
This enables piloting the functionality of EUDI (EU) 910/2014 Art. 45e.

In some cases, the QTSP may additionally be able to retrieve the values of attributes.

## Scenario: Payments sector

The authority responsible for an authentic source is a payment service provider. This provider may for example support attribute verification and/or retrieval using PSD2 (EU) 2025/2366 infrastructure.

## Scenario: Public sector

The authority responsible for an authentic source is a public service provider. This provider may for example support attribute verification and/or retrieval using SDG (EU) 2018/1724 infrastructure.
